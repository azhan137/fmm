# fmm
## Fast Multipole Method in Python
An implementation of the Fast Multipole Method for 2D Coulomb potentials for UC Berkeley Math 221 Numerical Linear Algebra Spring 2018.

* To people that are finding this repo useful: the fmm solutions using the adaptive quadtree for cases where some cells are spatially larger than others may still have some lingering bugs (when all cells are the same size there seems to be no problem).
